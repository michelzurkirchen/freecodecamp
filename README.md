# freeCodeCamp
A collection of the projects I have made as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

The projects in this repository generally have an original and an updated version. The original version follows the guidelines of the project instructions. In the updated version I deviate from the guidelines to create something that is more in line with best practices or more to my personal liking.
