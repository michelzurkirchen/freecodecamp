    <p>If you are familiar with the tech sector or with development specifically, you have probably heard of a website called <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>. If you are not familiar with it, freeCodeCamp is a free
      website featuring a self-paced curriculum that has helped millions of people worldwide to learn how to code and to land jobs as developers. The man that started this all is Quincy Larson.

    <p>Larson didn't always aspire to be a developer. He started out as a teacher. While living &mdash; and teaching &mdash; in China, he noticed that his colleagues were bogged down by administrative duties and could therefore spend less time on doing what
      they were supposed to be doing: teaching. Larson taught himself what he needed to know to automate much of these mundane tasks and he has been programming ever since.</p>

    <p>While Larson is successful now, this hasn't always been the case. He suffered from the same issue that many who are self taught suffer from: a lack of focus. Within several months time, Larson hopped around between different programming languages
      and different resources to learn these languages. Rather than becoming a master at one, he became a master of none.</p>

    <p>Larson set out to help others to overcome this obstacle and so in 2014 freeCodeCamp was born. The platform features a complete set of tutorials for various programming languages, to take someone from knowing nothing about programming, to being job
      ready. What makes freeCodeCamp even more unique is that it is completely free. To this day, Larson is still involved as a teacher.</p>

      <p>He is also an avid writer. You can find Larson on any of the below platforms. Just don't try to add him on LinkedIn, as he has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-just-hit-linkedins-30000-connection-limit-now-im-all-quincy-larson/" target="_blank">hit the 30.000 connections cap.</a></p>
